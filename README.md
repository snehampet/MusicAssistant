üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues
"Command not found" errors
‚Ä¢	Windows: Reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked
‚Ä¢	Mac/Linux: Use python3 and pip3 instead of python and pip
"No module named 'librosa'" error
pip install librosa numpy scipy
"Port already in use" error
‚Ä¢	Close other applications using port 5000
‚Ä¢	Or change port in backend.py: app.run(port=5001)
Large file download issues
‚Ä¢	Model files are 10MB+ total
‚Ä¢	Ensure stable internet connection
‚Ä¢	Use git clone rather than downloading ZIP
Audio processing takes too long
‚Ä¢	Expected: 30-60 seconds for analysis
‚Ä¢	Ensure sufficient RAM (4GB+ recommended)
‚Ä¢	Try with smaller audio files first


üìä Testing the Installation
Test Files to Try

‚Ä¢	User experience design for technical concepts

üèÜ Success Confirmation
You'll know it's working when:
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Browser shows the Music Assistant interface
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ File upload area is visible and functional
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Audio analysis completes without errors
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Results show genre prediction and feature analysis
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ SHAP analysis displays properly

THE AI WORKFLOW(just for a big picture view):
1.	librosa extracts 34 features from audio
2.	StandardScaler normalizes the features
3.	ü§ñ XGBoost model (THE AI) takes features ‚Üí predicts genre
4.	SHAP explains what the XGBoost model was "thinking"
SO WHEN WE SAY:
‚Ä¢	"AI predicts Rock with 73% confidence" = XGBoost model output
‚Ä¢	"AI has 82% accuracy" = XGBoost model performance
‚Ä¢	"AI looks at spectral contrast" = XGBoost learned these features matter

üìà Future Improvements
‚Ä¢	[ ] Expand to more genres(can be implemented with a more trustworthy dataset-would help ensure accuracy doesn't fall)
‚Ä¢	[ ] Add temporal analysis (verse/chorus detection)
‚Ä¢	[ ] Implement deep learning models(by working on a way better dataset next time, so that spectrogram analysis has a good quality and quantity of audio data to learn from!)
‚Ä¢	[ ] Real-time audio streaming analysis
‚Ä¢	[ ] Mobile app development
(Educational project - feel free to learn from and build upon this work. Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è for music educationüòç)
